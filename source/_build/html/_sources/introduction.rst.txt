Introduction 
============

This manual covers the operation of the XMT-R transmitter controller by Zonge International. This advanced, GPS synchronized transmitter controller was designed to be compatible with all Zonge transmitters. It has preset outputs for 50 % and 100 % duty-cycle waveforms over a wide range of frequencies and can be user programmed to generate specialized ternary transmission sequences.

The user can interact with the XMT-R through two different interfaces:

1. Directly on the hardware using its screen and physical buttons.
2. Remotely from a mobile phone or PC via a WiFi driven web interface.
